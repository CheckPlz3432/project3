        <p class="demonslayertext">Flash Breathing is a breathing style that is descended from Thunder Breathing, and wielded by users with sparking emotion but intense focus. This breathing style relys on fast and powerful strikes aimed at overwhelming and weakening the opponent. It's primary defense is centered in counterattacks and fast evasions focusing on the opponent's movements to counter their strikes. However, Flash Breathing is incredibly taxing, and like coal in a train, it requires it's user to have bodily fuel (food) and a energetic and healthy body to use it to it's full capabilities.</p>

          <h4>So I watched the anime Demon Slayer in 9th Grade, and finished the series by reading the manga in 11th Grade. I came up with my own fanmade breathing style, which is one of the sword styles meant to defeat demons in the series.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="demonslayerbackboxcolor">
          <p class="demonslayertext">Breathing Styles are swordsmanship styles that makes use of an esoteric breathing technique known as Total Concentration Breathing (Zen Shuchu no Kokyu in Japanese). In the anime, it's taught practiced and taught by members of the Demon Slayer Corps and are used in combat by Demon Slayers.</p>
          <p class="demonslayertext">ALL breathing techniques are based off of the original breath, Sun Breathing (Hi no Kokyu), and it's many subforms can mimic different elements, and parts of nature, even animals. (Ex. Flame, Water, Wind, Stone, Thunder are the five main breathing styles) (Serpent Breathing is a subform of Water Breathing, and Sound a subform of Thunder)</p>
          <p class="demonslayertext">When using a Breathing Style, users automatically visualize themselves manipulating the element or thing their style is based on, making it seem as if they were using magic, though those who are less expereinced or skilled in their style will visualize it less than those who are. (Ex. Using Flame Breathing and visualizing flames around your sword)</p>
          <p class="demonslayertext">It is also possible to mix different Breathing Styles if the user cannot master one particular Breathing Style alone in order to use the stronger aspects of different styles to compensate. (Sun Breathing with the movements of Water Breathing)</p>

        <h2 class="demonslayerheadertag">Flash Breathing's Five Breathing Techniques</h2>
        <div class="demonslayerbackboxcolor">
          <ul>
            <li class="demonslayertext">First Form, Rolling Thunder - Based off a technique of my friends; a speedy, arc-shaped slash.</li>
            <li class="demonslayertext">Second Form, Running Flash - Very taxing to overall stamina, but a lightning-fast dash towards an opponent, and also allows the user to propel on top of surfaces and through the air. This move is meant to disorient opponents with pure speed and momentum.</li>
            <li class="demonslayertext">Third Form, Thunder Rage - A direct barrage of high-speed slashes aimed at breaking through an opponent's layers of defense or equalizing an opponent's opposing attack strength.</li>
            <li class="demonslayertext">Fourth Form, Thunder Lily - Either an airborne vertical or strong, upward slash served for building momentum to clash with an opponent, and curved posture prevents this technique from being broken through easily.</li>
            <li class="demonslayertext">Fifth Form, Counter-flash - The Counter-flash is the most effective and focused counterattack of all Flash Breathing forms. The Counterflash serves to either redirect opposing strikes
        or projectiles, or to break an opponents attack entirely. The Counterflash focuses on attacking a certain portion of the sword similar to a power point
        to break through an opponent's defense, and can even break an oppoent's sword if done correctly and strong enough, though this has a incredibly low success rate.</li>
